We talk about statistical consulting in class today. I have no idea there could be so much money in that field, but now thinking about it the high pay totally makes sense, given the huge amount of skills and dedication is involved. Measuring the impact of statistical consultant, however, remains an interesting issue to consider, especially when considering businesses who may be spending hundreds of thousands on statisticians for their projects. What can statisticians do to “prove their worth” – to avoid the negative reputation that management consultants have garnered?

Why are some Political Science departments Bayesian and why are some others not? For sure, Bayesian analysis is still very new in the field, and there has not been much need for the kind of prediction enabled by Bayesian analysis.
