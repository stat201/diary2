I enjoyed this ???special guest star??? section a lot. I think this is a fantastic idea. It provides us a good opportunity to know more about some top people???s work, which we may never have this chance. I have to say all of them are outstanding. I even learned a lot from browsing their website. The conversation with them is also very inspiring. 

I especially like the guests to come to our classroom. The reason is that they prepared something interesting to show us, which can give us more ideas about their ongoing research work or something they thought are important. In addition, we also have the opportunity to ask them questions. (I don???t know if it???s possible that in the future, we could ask our guest to prepare one thing to show us, which will inspire us and also generate more conversation.) 

Our guest today is Dr. Dan Armendariz. He is very good at programing and was very kind to share a lot of information with us. He made efforts to prepare his talk apparently, which is great.
However, it would be better if Dr. Dan Armendariz could cut down his later technique talk and leave some time for us to ask questions. 

I was interested in his research on Online Course Tool for Adaptive Learning, which is kind of related to adaptive MOOCs, but I was not sure. So I asked him this question after class. He was very kind and forwarded me his publications.
